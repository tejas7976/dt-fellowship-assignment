# DT Fellowship Simulation Assignment
## Signal to Strategy: Boardroom Thinking for MSME Growth
**Role:** Growth Consultant (Simulation)
**Candidate:** Tejasva Midha

## Quick Start - Greeting Module

This repository includes a simple greeting program that responds to various greetings.

### Usage

```bash
python3 greeting.py
```

Or use it programmatically:

```python
from greeting import greet

response = greet("HI")
print(response)  # Output: Hello! Welcome to the DT Fellowship Assignment repository!
```

### Running Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest test_greeting.py -v
```

---
## Context
This assignment is approached not as a consulting task, but as a founder-level diagnosis
exercise.
The objective is to surface **hidden constraints**, design **systemic experiments**, and use
**AI as a thinking amplifier**, not a replacement for judgment.

## Part 1: Bottleneck Diagnosis Using Prompted AI Dialogue
### Simulated Founder Interview
> We started this company five years ago with just three people. Today we are a 45-member
team doing around ₹6 crore in annual revenue. Growth was fast in the first few years, but for the
last 18 months it feels like we are stuck. Sales targets are missed quarter after quarter even
though demand exists.
>
> I still get pulled into every major decision—pricing approvals, key client conversations, hiring
sign-offs. My leadership team depends on me a lot. When I step away, things slow down or
mistakes happen.
>
> We hired managers, but they don’t seem to truly own outcomes. Everyone works hard, but
firefighting has become normal. Processes exist on paper, but people bypass them to move
faster.
>
> Customers like our product, but we customize heavily for each client. This helps close deals
but increases delivery pressure. Margins are shrinking, and the team feels stretched.
>
> I feel exhausted. I know we need systems, but building them feels slower than fixing problems
myself. I worry that if I loosen control, quality will drop and clients will leave.
>
> I want to scale, but I don’t know where to start fixing things.

### Prompt 1: Founder Mindset & Mental Model
**AI Prompt**
> Analyze the founder’s language and decision patterns in the transcript to identify limiting
beliefs around control, delegation, and trust. Base insights strictly on the transcript.
**What This Prompt Uncovers**
- Fear of delegation
- Founder identity tied to being the primary problem-solver
- Control substituting for system trust
**Cialdini Principle**
- **Consistency** – past success reinforcing outdated behavior
**Negative Prompt**
- Avoid assumptions not grounded in the transcript
**Problem Layer**
- Founder’s mental model
---
### Prompt 2: Organizational & Systemic Issues
**AI Prompt**
> Identify structural breakdowns in roles, decision rights, and processes that reinforce
dependency on the founder and create firefighting loops.
**What This Prompt Uncovers**
- Unclear ownership
- Weak decision frameworks
- Process bypass culture
**Cialdini Principle**
- **Authority** – lack of clear authority pushes decisions upward
**Negative Prompt**
- Do not assume industry-specific best practices unless implied
**Problem Layer**
- Talent / process capability
---
### Prompt 3: Market & Capability Alignment
**AI Prompt**
> Evaluate whether the current customization-heavy sales approach aligns with delivery
capacity and leadership bandwidth. Identify risks to scale and margins.
**What This Prompt Uncovers**
- Over-customization
- Sales–delivery misalignment
- Margin erosion as a growth ceiling
**Cialdini Principle**
- **Reciprocity** – over-giving to win deals
**Negative Prompt**
- Avoid suggesting new markets or products not mentioned
**Problem Layer**
- Customer strategy / positioning
---
## Part 2: Growth Readiness Scorecard (GRS)
### 1. Founder & Leadership System
**Bottlenecks**
- Founder-centric decision-making
- Low trust in delegation
**Systemic Experiment**
- Decision Rights Charter
- Weekly reflection: “What decision should I not have made this week?”
**AI Co-Pilot Prompt**
> Simulate outcomes over 90 days if pricing and hiring decisions are delegated using clear
decision rules.
**Growth OS Stage**
- Delivery Engine Breakdown
---
### 2. Talent & Process Engine
**Bottlenecks**
- Role ambiguity
- Accountability focused on effort, not outcomes
**Systemic Experiment**
- Weekly Ownership Review
- Role scorecards with outcome metrics
**AI Co-Pilot Prompt**
> Design role scorecards for department heads that shift accountability from activities to
outcomes.
**Growth OS Stage**
- Talent Mismatch
---
### 3. Customer & Value Strategy
**Bottlenecks**
- Excessive customization
- Margin leakage
**Systemic Experiment**
- Standardization Sprint
- Tiered offerings based on core use cases
**AI Co-Pilot Prompt**
> Simulate financial and operational impact if customization is reduced by 30% and replaced
with standardized packages.
**Growth OS Stage**
- Problem–Market Fit Stress
---
## Part 3: Strategic Reflection
AI did not provide answers—it expanded my thinking surface. Prompting helped separate
symptoms from root causes and revealed how founder psychology, systems, and market
choices reinforce each other.
The key insight is that **growth bottlenecks are internal constraints exposed by scale**, not
external failures. What breaks at scale is not the business—it is the invisible assumptions that
once worked.
The principle I will carry into every growth diagnosis is:
**Scale reveals truth. Resistance signals where redesign is required.**
A Growth Consultant must operate as:
- **Coach** – surfacing fears and blind spots
- **Analyst** – identifying structural patterns
- **Operator** – designing experiments that convert insight into action
Growth is not about working harder.
It is about redesigning the system so leadership energy flows forward, not downward.
